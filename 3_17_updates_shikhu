Next Steps
Train Model on Real Handwriting Samples**
- Collect real handwriting samples** from our generated passage.
- Label new data (match handwritten text with transcription).
- Add new samples to training set and retrain model.

Evaluate Model Performance**
- Check accuracy, loss, and validation results.
- Improve model by **tuning hyperparameters**.

Prepare Final Model for Testing**
- Test on new unseen handwriting samples*
- Deploy initial test model for feedback.
